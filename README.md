# Quant-Topics
A collection of different topics that are key to answer questions in quant interviews for finance.

Preparing for interviews is always challenging especially since one does not know what topics are
worth covering. Quant interviews are especially challenging. There are tons of questions online
and some good books with even more questions but when starting out it is impossible to answer them
all as usually one does not have the mathematical knowledge to cover them. You might now say:
'Wait! I have a degree in maths/finance/computer science whatever and I can do it!'. Well,
these questions are different. They are not particular hard besides some selected few but you need 
to solve them on the spot and most of them require tricks. Calculation with tricks needs practice 
and method. Otherwise you won't be able to get the solution quickly. This is what this guide will 
provide: Methods with tricks to solve most quant interview questions. It is what you have to know/learn
to be able to tackle these questions.

This guide will be updated from time to time and will cover (hopefully) all topics in the end.

One line about myself: I am a PhD graduate in Actuarial Science with a BSc and MSc in mathematics.
