# Ordinary Differential Equations

Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are asked from time to time. If they are it is best to have practiced them.
There are not many ODEs that are important. We will cover 4 cases of ODEs here.

- ODEs with seperated variables
- Linear ODEs
- Homogeneous ODEs
- Linear ODEs higher order with constant coefficiants
